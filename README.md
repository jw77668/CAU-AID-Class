# KNN Iris Classifier

This project demonstrates a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for the Iris dataset. The application allows users to:
1. Tune the hyperparameter `k` (number of neighbors).
2. Evaluate the model's performance (accuracy and balanced accuracy).
3. Predict the iris species based on user-provided input.

## Features
- Hyperparameter tuning for KNN (`k` selection).
- Model training and evaluation.
- Console-based user input for custom predictions.
- Performance metrics: Accuracy and Balanced Accuracy.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CAU-AID-Class.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CAU-AID-Class
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
4. Ensure the `iris.csv` dataset is available in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python knn_iris_classifier.py
   ```
3. Enter the number of neighbors('k') when prompted.
4. View the model's accuacy and balanced accuracy in the console.
5. Input 'sepal.length' and 'petal.length' in the format 'value1, value2' to predict the iris species.

## Example
### console Interaction
```bash
Enter the number of neighbors (k) for KNN: 5
Model Accuracy: 0.95
Balanced Accuracy: 0.96
Enter the sepal.length and petal.length for the iris in the format 'sepal_length,petal_length': 1.6,4
Predicted Label:  Versicolor
```

## Note
-Ensure that the input for predictions is numeric and follows the correct format ('value1, value2').
-Modify the dataset loading path is the scrit if necessary.
